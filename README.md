PROJECT IDEA

This baseline project is to serve as a template for basic site creation. The initial idea is to create a template that can be used without any framework and dependencies. After success, the project will be redone using frameworks to further enhance the customizability of the site, for example having an admin section dedicated to customize the styling and naming of pages.
